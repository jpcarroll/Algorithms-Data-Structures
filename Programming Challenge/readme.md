# Implementation of Four Programming Challenges

## Programming Challenges from Algorithms and Data Structures

## Getting Started
* Compiling and running problem 1:
```
g++ -Wall prob1.cpp -o prob1
./prob1
```
* Compiling and running problem 2:
```
g++ -Wall prob2.cpp -o prob2
./prob2
```
* Compiling and running problem 3:
```
g++ -Wall stringset.cpp prob3.cpp -o prob3
./prob3
```
* Compiling and running problem 4:
```
g++ -Wall prob4.cpp -o prob4
./prob4
```
